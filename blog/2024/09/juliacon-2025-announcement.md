## Julia Community Efforts

We have a couple new community efforts we’d like to talk about!

### Julia Online Videos

We have a lot of community members who want to give presentations at JuliaCon each year but can’t make it. We receive a lot of requests to submit videos to the conference, but for now we intend to run JuliaCon as an in-person conference first and foremost. Hybrid conferences take a lot of effort, and have a negative impact on the in-person experience.

As an alternative we are starting a new trial program for community members to propose videos for upload to the Julia YouTube Channel. If your proposal is accepted you’ll be asked to prepare your proposal into a full video for upload! This call for proposals will be evergreen, it will be open for as long as we run this program so you are welcome to propose a video at any time.

Our YouTube channel is a fantastic forum for you to advertise your packages / work, present tutorials which drive users to the Julia ecosystem, or to present unique perspectives on your favorite problem in computer science, software development, or scientific computing! We have well over 100k views per month, and a lot of impressions on each video we upload.

If this program interests you please fill out the following form:

### JuliaCon Locals

We had over a dozen community members reach out to talk about hosting a JuliaCon Local at JuliaCon 2024! 
The first step in this process is always to start a local meetup. We’re happy to help with that as much as we can, you can reach out on the #community channel on Slack at any time. 

Once you have an established meetup and you’d like to host a JuliaCon Local please reach out to raye@julialang.org or ranjan@julialang.org for more information.

We are working on a unified playbook for how to build your local community, how to get access to awesome speakers, and how to find spaces and funds for your meetup, so please keep an eye out for that on our usual channels!

### Julia Community Prizes

We want to be sure you didn’t miss the Julia Community Prizes. These prizes were announced at the closing session of JuliaCon 2024 on July 12th, but if you missed it the awardees this year were:

\- **The JuMP Team**: Including **Oscar Dowson**, Benoît Legat, and **Miles Lubin**, for their long-term commitment to JuMP.jl and the broader mathematical programming ecosystem in Julia.

\- **The Makie Team:** Including **Simon Danisch**, **Julius Krumbiegel**, **Frederic Freyer**, and **Anshul Singhvi**, for their creation of Makie.jl and improvements to the state of data visualization in Julia.

\- **Guillaume Dalle:** For his various contributions to the Julia ecosystem including DifferentiationInterface.jl and ModernJuliaWorkflows.

Awardees are nominated by the Julia community, and then winners are selected by a committee of senior community members based on their holistic contributions across the ecosystem.

### JuliaCon 2024 Organizers and Volunteers

JuliaCon wouldn’t happen without an amazing group of organizers and volunteers. The organizing committee put in an incredible amount of work over the past year, and an incredible 70+ volunteers made the conference possible.

I first want to highlight the incredible Local Organizing Committee. Led by Gareth Thomas, who is unmatched in his ability to bring people together for a common cause, the local committee was the key to both JuliaCon Local Eindhoven and JuliaCon Global 2024!

\- Max van Dijk, ASML: Local Organizer

\- Erwin Hoogerwoord, TU/e: Local Organizer + Workshops
